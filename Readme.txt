Installation
============

On Windows precompiled executables are on the \bin folder. For Linux and Mac
it is required that you compile the code. Two modes are possible:

1) In the automatic mode you just type
    
             python setup.py

And a user friendly installation will start.

2) The other possibility is the manual compilation and it is valid
for any O.S. This mode is detailed on the guide in pdf format.
